* Auto-update status of feeds is now more general and complete. (issue #91)

* Fixed #76, now user can choose to "not show the dialog again" when opening hyperlink from message previewer. This only concerns the lite version of RSS Guard which uses simpler text component for message previewing.

Changed:
* (Linux only) Primary user data/config storage is now undex $HOME/.config/RSS Guard. XDG_CONFIG_HOME variable is respected. If old user data is detected, then old user data path is used. Note that the location of cache is now changed too to $XDG_{CACHE,DATA}_HOME/RSS Guard.
* RSS Guard now uses "_" character as localization file names separator. (issue #75)
* Localizations are now placed in "translations" subfolder instead of "l10n" subfolder. (issue #75)

-----

Fixed:
* Percent HTML encoding is now decoded when messages are downloaded. (bug #83)

3.3.6
-----

Added:
* User now can place custom user skins in user "data" folder. (issue #81) See "About" dialog for the exact path.

* Height if message attachment image is now configurable, defaults to 36. (issue #69)

* Fixed problem with updating states of messages in Nextcloud. Remove and re-add your account to fix the problem!! (bug #59)

-----

Added:
* Development builds are now automatically compiled for Windows and Mac OS X. See https://github.com/martinrotter/rssguard/tree/build-artifacts for links and more information.
* RSS Guard now can be compiled WITHOUT QtWebEngine module. Minimal Qt required was also lowered to 5.6.0.

Changed:

* Big application core refactoring. Many functions rewritten, some bad code removed.

Fixed:
* RSS Guard could not stop ongoing feed updates. (bug #52)
* RSS Guard was not launchable in Windows XP. (bug #53)

* RSS Guard correctly saves windows size/position when maximized on exit. (bug #45)

Changed:
* Focused message is now displayed in previewer when multiple messages are selected. This is related to bug #46.
* MariaDB binary DLL file updated to 10.1.16 (Windows only).

3.3.2
-----

Changed:

Fixed:
* Fixed problems with obtaining custom ID for downloaded messages in TT-RSS plugin. This caused probably a lot of problems with mismatch of downloaded/real unread messages counts.
* Fixed some typos.
* Fixed some UI stuff in menus etc.
* Fixed problem with skin loading. (bug #25)

You can see more verbose list of fixed stuff here: https://github.com/martinrotter/rssguard/milestone/2?closed=1

-----

Changed:

* Changed codes of localizations and localizations loading. (bug #19)

Fixed:
* Fixed problematic message reselection when filtering messages.
* Fixed problem when updating 0 feeds - GUI lockup.
* Fixed minimum allowed length of category/feed titles. (bug #17)

3.3.0
-----

Added:
* Internal message viewer is now based on QtWebEngine module which is based on Chromium project. This speeds up viewing of messages and supports newest HTML 5 or CSS 3 features. Note that this does not mean that fully featured internal web browser will come back. It will not! Only SIMPLIFIED internal web browser is now added. New message viewer is also better for viewing messages in newspaper mode.
* Default skin now uses Bootrstrap-powered look.
* Feed updates are now parallelized up to infinite number of threads. This speeds up speed of concurrent feed updates rapidly (more than 5 times). I was able to update about 160 feeds in 35 seconds. Note that this feature is still in experimental state.
* Middle mouse button click on any message in message list opens message in internal web browser, double click in external web browser.
* Any middle mouse button click on hyperlink opens it in new internal web browser tab.

Changed:
* Minimal Qt version bumped to 5.7.0 - this will lead to some betere features in the future.
* Updated miscellaneous libraries - MariadDB, openSSL (Windows only).
* Main menu is by default hidden, tab bar is now always visible. Main menu is now accessible via left/top corner iconified button. Users can of course tweak settings in Tools -> Options -> User interface.

Removed:
* All skins except default are removed because it is difficult for me to maintain all of them. Any user can pickup removed skin from repository, tweak it (it is easy) and send it to me and I will include it with next version of RSS Guard.
* Cmake dependency completely removed!
* Completely abandoned support for self-updating via NSIS installers. Now, RSS Guard is distributed only via ZIP archives on Windows. User still can download them in RSS Guard.

Fixed:
* Removed "Restart" functionality, it was buggy and was causing a lot of internal problems, primarily with storing settings.
* OPML exporter now generates valid XML with all xmlns correctly filled.

3.2.4
-----

Fixed:
* Auto-update interval/type is now persistent across sync-in for TT-RSS/ownCloud.

3.2.3
-----

Changed:
* Some minor tweaks for default icon theme loading.


3.2.2
-----

Added:
* RSS Guard now supports system-wide icon themes and on Windows -> built-in Faenza theme was tweaked.
* ownCloud plugin now allows to add feeds and rename feeds.

Fixed:
* Some minor buggies and code mistakes.
* Fixed problem with message counts.

3.2.1
-----

Added:
* Internal message previewer now introduces list of images contained in message contents of displayed message.

Fixed:
* Changes in count of all/unread messages are now faster. This results in (much) faster program startup when using BIG database file.

Changed:
* Internal message viewer now displays title as part of main HTML view.

3.2.0
-----

Main:
* Internal web browser was REMOVED. This is because old Qt WebKit web component will be removed from Qt and new Qt component for web viewing is based on Chromium, which is fucking joke. Some people hate Chromium because of many (technocal, philosophical, etical) reasons. Moreover, it lacks some useful features and is memory hungry. It is also very buggy in Qt now. Therefore now internal web browser is gone. Message preview component now uses much lighter solution and still can display certain HTML subset. RSS Guard was tweaked to be more friendly to external web browser. Double-clicking any message results in it being opened via external web browser.
* PLEASE, fill this survey: http://goo.gl/forms/ASWg4TFxlS
* RSS Guard now depends only Qt 5.6 or higher.

Added:
* ownCloud plugin now can delete feeds and edit auto-update policy of feeds.
* Global auto-update feed interval spinbox now has better format. (issue #176)
* Message preview's font is now fully adjustable in settings. (issue #177)
* RSS Guard now automatically switches to SQLite backend if MySQL is not available on program startup.
* Newspaper view now allows marking individual messages read/unread/starred/unstarred.
* Added experimental support for tweakable statusbar. (issue #158)
* Opening of download manager when new file download starts is now optional. (issue #165)

Fixed:
* Download manager now correctly displays download progress/info.
* Better detection of MySQL server status. (bug #169)
* Ordering of messages is now done on SQL server (stands for both MySQL and SQLite). (bug #172)
* Now title of the RSS/ATOM message is taken into account when deciding message "uniqueness". (bug #171)
* MySQL scripts improved. (bug #170)
