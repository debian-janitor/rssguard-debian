4.0.4
-----

RSS Guard now has its own DISCORD: https://discord.gg/7xbVMPPNqH

Added:
* Updated documentation. (#516)
* Sizes of horizontal/vertical width/height of article preview are now kept separately. User can thus have different sizes of article preview in each layout. (#515)
* Added new simplistic skin "nudus". (#512)
* Article filters now can determine "uniqueness" of article according to article's "id". (#509)
* Some columns in article list now also display respective values in tooltips. (#513)
* Columns "read" and "important" in article list are now resizable. (#514)

Fixed:
* Avoid unwanted displays of article previewer. (#507)
* "Automatically expand item when selected" now behaves consistently when launched with keyboard shortcut. (#506)
* Fixed multiple issues regarding article "focus" or "selection".
* Fixed some problems with recognizing filenames when downloading files.
* Fixed crash when repeatedly downloading some files.
* Tweaked some icons.
* Fixed executable bits on some deployed files.
* Updated skin "API".

4.0.3
-----

Added:
* Now it is possible to disable hardcoded keyboard shortcuts in feed/article lists so that user-defined single-stroke shortcuts can work properly. (#484)
* Skins were reverted to 4.0.1 as they were very buggy. Previous skins were stable and will be used for time to come. I will make brand new polished skin in some next release which will not replace existing skins but will be added.

Fixed:
* Settings dialog now remembers its size and also adds scrollbars where needed. Also was polished a bit. (#493)
* Icon of "standard RSS/ATOM/..." service/account was updated to be "RSS" icon, not "RSS Guard" icon and also is preselected in "Add account" dialog.
* Updated documentation and translations.
* "Written by" bottom section of article preview now uses same date/time format as article list.
* Code refactored.
* Icons are now properly loaded when fetching list of feeds in Tiny Tiny RSS.
* Inline article searching now uses much smaller delay after typing search phrase.

4.0.2
-----

Added:
* Documentation now contains section for DIY migration of data from RSS Guard 3.x line.
* Updated localizations.
* Notification sounds now have adjustable volume. (#488)
* Searching in articles is now performed with delay after search expression is typed. (#485)
* Big account "edit" dialogs now have scrollbars if they are too big to fit on screen. (#483)
* Both built-in skins now use same Pico.css CSS library and have unified look for both light and dark variants (except of dark colors of course).

Fixed:
* Gstreamer libraries are now bundled into AppImage version of RSS Guard.
* Feedly now fetches messages correctly, no more message disappearing, related algorithm for article DB storing was also updated. (#487)
* AdBlock local Node.js-based server now has only really needed dependencies.
* Fixed problem with linking "librssguard.so" on some Linux distributions. (#486)

4.0.0
-----

4.0.0 is new major release of RSS Guard. RSS Guard 4.x is NOT backwards compatible with 3.x line. Specifically:
* configuration file "config.ini" IS fully backwards compatible,
* database file "database.db" is NOT backwards compatible.

You may ask why is there new major version and why backwards compatibility is broken:
* I needed to completely overhaul some of core concepts inside RSS Guard.
* Database structure in file "database.db" was very complicated and hard to maintain and had to be simplified. Number of database tables was greatly reduced and whole structure is easier to follow.
* Source code was greatly simplified in many places which makes RSS Guard easier to maintain and easier to develop new features.
* Also, and this is potential killer feature, new changes allowed implementation of "next-gen" synchronization algorithms which may, in some cases, dramatically speed-up two-way synchronization of articles. This new synchronization algorithm is right now implemented and enabled for Google Reader API plugin as PoC and it is called "Intelligent synchronization algorithm" within RSS Guard. The algorithm will be implemented for other plugins over time.
* There is crazy number of new features and bugfixes. See list below.
* Also, let me say some more extra points:
    * More than 4 000 code changes were made in total during RSS Guard development. Codebase consists of 38 500 lines of C++ code.
    * First version of RSS Guard was published 8 years ago.
    * RSS Guard is one-man project, I have implemented it on my own. 99% of code is written from scratch.
    * Received donations for RSS Guard were under 100 USD in total.
    * If you feel that RSS Guard is slow, broken or shitty application, then you are probably right. Nonetheless, you should still submit well-structured and sane bug report, so that I can actually fix the issue! If you do not submit bug report, then please do no spread lies about how bad RSS Guard is and switch to another feed reader instead. 

Added:
* Brand new notifications subsystem added. It can play sounds, individual events are independently configurable in application settings. (#356, #144)
* "MessageObject" class now exposes "rawContents" property for message filtering. Property contains raw RSS/ATOM/JSON contents of the message. (#377)
* URL-embedded cookies are now supported, as well as classic cookies, which are now saved in non-persistent cookie jar. (#391)
* "Next-gen" synchronization algorithms which may, in some cases, dramatically speed-up two-way synchronization of articles. This new synchronization algorithm is right now implemented and enabled for Google Reader API plugin as PoC and is called "Intelligent synchronization algorithm" within RSS Guard. The algorithm will be also implemented for other plugins in the future.
* Google Reader API plugin supports "ot" option.
* Documentation was completely rewritten.
* Fixed support for OS/2.
* Optional notification for login failures.

* Google Reader API plugin is greatly enhanced, has better support for TheOldReader.
* Inoreader plugin was merged into Google Reader API plugin as Inoreader too uses Google Reader API.
* Toolbar search boxes have now dynamic width. (#431)
* Visual state of some dialogs is now remembered, for example "Cleanup database".
* Some GUI texts and terms were unified and changed (message -> article, download feed -> fetch feed, etc.). (#430)
* There is now some default filename set when exporting feeds to file.
* Number of unread messages is now shown on Linux also in taskbar (not just tray icon). (#437)
* Unified minimize/maximize/close window buttons in all RSS Guard dialogs. (#439)
* Most of text boxes now have "clear text" button. (#438)
